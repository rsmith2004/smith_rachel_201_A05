# Instructions

1. **Write your name** on the assignment

2. Write your code in the *Code* cells of the **template provided** to write solutions for the assignment. **Do not open a new qmd**, and work from scratch. Ensure that the solution is written neatly enough to understand and grade.

3. You may talk to a friend, discuss the questions and potential directions for solving them. However, you need to write your own solutions and code separately, and not as a group activity. Do not use AI to solve the problems.

4. There are point deductions if your code is not clean and organized.

5. Only print what is asked for. Highly inefficient code will be deducted for because it demonstrates lack of understanding.

6. Render as an HTML and **submit BOTH the .qmd and HTML file**.

The grader cannot grade what they cannot see! Failure to render your document after completing all questions will lead to deductions.

## Question 2 (8 points)

Consider the list of lists below containing basketball player information.

```{r}
player_info <- list(MJ = list(name = "Michael Jordan",
                              postion = "shooting guard",
                              games_played = 179,
                              points = 5987,
                              assists = 1022),
                    LJ = list(name = "LeBron James",
                              postion = "small forward",
                              games_played = 287,
                              points = 8162,
                              assists = 2067),
                    KB = list(name = "Kobe Bryant",
                              postion = "shooting guard",
                              games_played = 220,
                              points = 5640,
                              assists = 1040),
                    KA = list(name = "Kareem Abdul-Jabbar",
                              postion = "center",
                              games_played = 237,
                              points = 5762,
                              assists = 767),
                    SO = list(name = "Shaquille O'Neal",
                              postion = "center",
                              games_played = 216,
                              points = 5250,
                              assists = 582))
```


### Part a (1 point)

Extract the value `8162` (LeBron James points) in 2 different ways:

- using indexing 
- using names

```{r}
#extracting using indexing
player_info[[2]][[4]]

#extracting using names
player_info$LJ$points


```


### Part b (3 points)

Add a new named element to the end of each player's list called `height`. The heights in inches are as follows: MJ = 78; LJ = 81; KB = 78; KA = 86; SO = 85.

Print the `player_info` list to prove you were successful.

```{r}
heights <- c(MJ = 78, LJ = 81, KB = 78, KA = 86, SO = 85) 

for (player in names(player_info)) {
  player_info[[player]]$height <- heights[[player]]
}

# printing the updated  list
player_info


#why is it printing the initials???
#because each height is a list, why is this happening????


#### OR ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO THIS:

player_info$MJ$height <- 78
player_info$LJ$height <- 81
player_info$KB$height <- 78
player_info$KA$height <- 86
  player_info$SO$height <- 85
```


### Part c (3 points)

Create a new list that contains elements corresponding to each player's `points_per_game`. 

- `points_per_game = points/games_played`

Name each element with the respective player's initials.

ie: The first element of the list will be 33.44693 and the name of this element will be MJ.

Hint: initialize an empty list

Note: this must still run correctly even if the values were to change or if another player were added to the list or if the player order changed.

```{r}
points_per_game <- list()

for (player in names(player_info)){
  x_points <- player_info[[player]]$points
  x_games_played <- player_info[[player]]$games_played
  points_per_game[[player]] <- x_points / x_games_played 

}
points_per_game

```




### Part d (1 point)

Use the list created in Part c and an appropriate apply function to round each value to two decimal places.

Store the output as a vector and print the results.

```{r}
rounded_ppg <- sapply(points_per_game, function(x){round(x, digits = 2)})
rounded_ppg

```


## Question 3 (3 points)

Consider the matrix `mat_rand` of random numbers below.

```{r}
rand_num <- c(sample(10:100, 10), sample(100:999, 10), sample(1000:2000, 10))

mat_rand <- matrix(sample(rand_num, 30), ncol = 5)
```

Use an appropriate apply function to round values with 2 digits to the nearest tens, values with 3 digits to the nearest hundreds, and 4 digits to the nearest thousands.

ie: 91 rounds to 90; 173 rounds to 200; 1450 rounds to 1000

Hint: use `MARGIN = 1:2` to apply the function to each value instead of only a row/col.

```{r}
#function rounding depending on the digit 
round_digits <- function(x){
  if (nchar(x) == 2){ #rounding for two digits
    return(round(x, -1))
  }else if (nchar(x) == 3){ #rounding for three digits
    return(round(x, -2))
  }else if(nchar(x) == 4){ #rounding for four digits
    return(round(x, -3))
  }
}

#applying function to matrix
mat_round <- apply(mat_rand, 1:2, round_digits)

#printing newly created matrix 
mat_round


```


## Question 4 (9 points)

Run the below code chunk to load a data frame named `max_temps` into your Environment. May need to install `tidyverse` and `janitor` first in order for this to run. You can install packages by clicking on the **Packages** tab in the bottom right pane followed by clicking **Install**.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

temp_url <- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biodash/biodash.github.io/master/assets/data/temperature/co_oh_va_max_temp.txt'
temp_file <- 'state_max_temps.tsv'
download.file(url = temp_url, destfile = temp_file)

max_temps <- read_tsv("state_max_temps.tsv") |> 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

### Part a (2 points)

Calculate the average temperature for each month across the whole data frame (using the data for all three states together).

```{r}

#calculating averages by applying mean function to the months columns
#storing the output
avg_temp <- apply(max_temps[, c('jan', 'feb', 'mar', 'apr', 'may', 'jun', 'jul', 'aug', 'sep', 'oct', 'nov', 'dec')], 2, mean)

#printing the averages
avg_temp



#avg_temp <- apply(max_temps[, 'jan':'dec'], 2, mean)
#why does this not work
#what is the output supposed to be? data frame too? 

```


### Part b (2 points)

Create three new data frames by slicing the data by state.

- Slice the data frame to only include the state of Colorado (CO).
- Slice the data frame to only include the state of Ohio (OH).
- Slice the data frame to only include the state of Virginia (VA).

No need to print any output here.

```{r}

#data frame for Colorado
CO_temps <- subset(max_temps, state == "CO")
  
#data frame for Ohio
OH_temps <- subset(max_temps, state == "OH")
  
#data frame for Virginia 
VA_temps <- subset(max_temps, state == "VA")

```


### Part c (5 points)

Calculate the **median annual** temperature for your Colorado data set. 

Use the `which.max()` and `which.min()` function to determine which year had the highest median temperature and which year had the lowest median temperature.

Then print the sentence:

"The maximum median annual temperature of {} occurred in {} and the minimum median annual temperature of {} occurred in {}."

Example (this is NOT the answer just an example of what goes in the {}):

"The maximum median annual temperature of 68.25 occurred in 2017 and the minimum median annual temperature of 57.15 occurred in 1907."

Note: This code should still run successfully even if the numbers were to change.

```{r}
#calculating the median for each year 
med_ann <- apply(CO_temps[, c('jan', 'feb', 'mar', 'apr', 'may', 'jun', 'jul', 'aug', 'sep', 'oct', 'nov', 'dec')], 1, median)

#printing the sentence + calculating the max/min + finding the year by indexing
print(paste0("The maximum median annual temperature of ", max(med_ann), 
             " occurred in ", CO_temps$year[which.max(med_ann)], 
             " and the minimum median annual temperature of ", min(med_ann), 
             " occurred in ", CO_temps$year[which.min(med_ann)],"."))

```


## Question 5 (5 points)

Write a recursive function that calculates the sum of the digits in a number. 

Example: The number 312 would return 6 (3 + 1 + 2)

Run your function with 935068.

```{r}

#recursive function calculating the sum of the digits
sum_of_digits <- function(num){
  #base case: if the number is a single digit, stop
  if(num < 10){ 
    return(num)
  }else{
    #recursive case, adding last number to the rest of the sum_of_digits
    return(num %% 10 + sum_of_digits(num %/% 10))
  }
}

#running the function
sum_of_digits(935068)
```
